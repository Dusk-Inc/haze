## feat-169 — Vectorized tensor engine

Fibery: [Feature 169](https://dusk-inc.fibery.io/Development/Features/169) (Product: Haze, Type: Update).

Replaces the threaded/queue object-graph simulation with a PyTorch tensor engine, and packages
the result as a loadable Hugging Face model. Branch `feat-169`, cut from `dev`.

### Why the rewrite

The prior engine represented every neuron as a Python object holding `list[Connector]`, every
signal as a `Signal` object mutated in place, and propagated by a `ThreadPoolExecutor` fanning one
thread per input feature, each draining a `queue.Queue` of `(callable, args)` closures. Three
problems, in order of severity:

1. **Cost grows with training time, not just network size.** The per-edge loop guard
   `Connector._history` was a `list[UUID]` that was never cleared — `clear_history()` had zero
   callers — and was scanned with a linear `in` on every edge fire. `Motor._signals` grew by
   `np.append` for the same reason. The engine was asymptotically wrong, not constant-factor slow.
2. **The threads bought nothing.** The work is GIL-bound Python, and the per-object `Queue` in
   `Connector`/`Inter`/`Motor`/`Registry` was always enqueue-then-drain-one — no buffering, no
   concurrency, pure lock and allocation overhead on the hot path.
3. **It was racy.** N feature threads mutated shared `Registry` numpy arrays, `Inter._signal_buffer`,
   `Connector._history`, and `Motor._signals` under per-object `RLock`s that covered only the
   trivial dequeue, never the read-modify-write. `Inter.transmit` was not synchronized at all.

### Baseline of the prior engine, measured before replacement

Captured on the 8-bit binary-sequence echo demo (`app/main.py`), 200 rows per seed, on this
devcontainer. The prior engine remains recoverable at commit `20ef84f`.

| seed | mean reward | 1st half → 2nd half | median ms/step | first 10 steps → last 10 steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | 0.492 | 0.495 → 0.489 | 167 | 54 ms → 458 ms |
| 4  | 0.498 | 0.514 → 0.483 | 190 | 68 ms → 481 ms |
| 42 | 0.488 | 0.499 → 0.478 | 171 | 63 ms → 501 ms |

Three facts to carry forward:

- **No learning is demonstrated.** Reward sits at chance and if anything declines across the run.
  This is not conclusive evidence the engine failed to learn, because the task cannot show
  learning either way: `generate_binary_sequence` emits uniform random bits, so chance = ceiling =
  0.5 and a flat curve is indistinguishable from a broken engine. It does mean the demo is
  worthless as a regression oracle, which is why `src/functions/score.py` adds tasks with a real
  learnable ceiling (constant, copy, parity) as the actual validation method.
- **Step time grew ~8× over 200 rows** and shows no sign of levelling. Extrapolated to the demo's
  own 10,000 rows, a single step would take tens of seconds. This is the `_history` and
  `_signals` growth described above, and it is the primary thing the rewrite fixes.
- **Half the seeds do not run at all.** Seeds 2, 3, and 5 die with `Network did not connect signal
  to motors within the iteration limit` — the random wiring fails to reach the motors and the
  recovery loop in `Haze.predict` exhausts its retries. Any claim about the prior engine's
  behavior is conditioned on a surviving seed.

### Semantics: deliberate divergences from the prior engine

The rewrite adopts clean semantics rather than reproducing the prior behavior bug-for-bug. Each
item below is a behavior change, not a refactor, and each is landed as its own commit so a
regression is attributable.

- **Motors reset per observation.** `Motor.reset_state()` set `self._state = 0`, an attribute
  nothing read; the real accumulator `self._signals` was never cleared. Motor activations therefore
  accumulated for the entire process lifetime, so every prediction after the first was contaminated
  by all prior ones. `Decoder._reset_motors()` called it before and after every `predict()`
  believing state was cleared.
- **Interneurons genuinely accumulate fan-in.** `Inter.transmit` buffered arriving signals, summed
  them, and then cleared `_signal_buffer` unconditionally at the end of every call — and
  `Context.run` delivered one ingress per call. So `total_value` was almost always a single
  signal, and the effective gate was per-arriving-edge rather than a spatial sum. Multi-signal
  merges happened only when two feature threads raced. The tensor engine's scatter-accumulate
  implements the accumulation the prior code described but did not perform, which means
  `neuron_firing_threshold` must be recalibrated upward (see `specs/propagation.md`).
- **Terminus→motor edges are learnable.** `Decoder.check_terminus` constructed `Connector`s and
  posted them without calling `registry.add_connector`, leaving `_index is None`, so
  `get_strength()` returned a hardcoded `0.9` and `activate_connector` was never reached. Every
  such edge was permanently pinned at near-maximum strength and invisible to learning.
- **Pruned edges stop participating in learning.** Pruning removed connectors from
  `Registry._connectors` but never removed their `_strength`/`_epsilon`/`_status` slots. Because
  `learn(reverse=True)` selects on `~_status`, every orphaned slot was reverse-learned on every
  reverse pass, forever, and the arrays grew monotonically.
- **Confidence is computed over active motors only.** `Decoder.confidence()` took entropy over
  `get_motors()` while `_predict_impl` used `get_active_motors()`, so confidence was systematically
  deflated by an inactive label space. It feeds both the learning delta and the growth trigger.
- **Propagation order changes from depth-first drain to synchronous wavefront.** `Sensor.transmit`
  called `context.run()` *inside* its loop over connections, so one out-edge's entire cascade
  drained before the next was enqueued, and edge claiming was arrival-order dependent. The tensor
  engine fires all edges of a wavefront together and resolves contention by summation. This makes
  results order-independent and reproducible; the prior engine was not reproducible even with a
  fixed seed.

### Approximation introduced

`Signal.get_actual() = value · exp(sum_log / path_length)` is a per-path quantity, and a state
vector merges paths. The engine carries `value`, `sum_log`, and `path_length` as parallel node
vectors and, at merge points, takes a value-weighted mean of `sum_log` and `path_length`. This is
algebraically exact wherever fan-in is 1. Where fan-in exceeds 1 it under-estimates by
approximately `Var_w(g)/2` by Jensen — bounded at ≤8% for realistic strengths in [0.4, 0.9] and
~45% in the pathological two-path extreme. The error is one-signed (never an over-estimate), so it
tightens the edge gate rather than loosening it, and is absorbed by recalibrating
`signal_threshold`.

### What the rewrite revealed: the learning rule does not do credit assignment

The tensor engine is verified correct — it agrees with a plain-Python reference implementation to
float32 precision across every seed tested, propagation terminates on the cyclic nexus mesh, and
step time is now **flat** where the prior engine's grew without bound. It is also demonstrably
faster: ~2.6 ms per observe/predict/learn step at 300 rows against the prior engine's ~470 ms at
the same point, and the gap widens with run length rather than closing.

But validating on task rather than on bug-parity surfaced something the speedup does not fix.
`Δ = ε · (reward − confidence)` is applied uniformly to every edge in the fired trace. When two
motors compete, **both** of their inbound edges are in that trace and both move by the same delta
with the same sign. The rule therefore cannot make the correct motor win; whichever motor leads at
initialization keeps leading. Full measurements are in `specs/learning.md` — the short version is
that the constant task, which any working learner must score ~1.0 on, scores 0.00 across seeds and
across three orders of magnitude of learning rate.

Two effects were separated. Saturation is a calibration fault: at the inherited `epsilon_start =
0.7`, a single observation moves an edge rail to rail, every fired edge pins to the ceiling within
a few steps, both motors receive numerically identical activation, and confidence and therefore the
delta both collapse to exactly zero. A smaller rate avoids that. But with the rate small enough
that strengths stay spread, reward still does not leave chance — so the second effect is not
calibration.

This is inherited, not introduced. The prior engine applied the same rule to the same mask, and its
own measured baseline is flat at chance with three of six seeds failing to reach the motors at all.
It also explains that baseline, which the random-bit demo could not: the demo's chance and ceiling
are both 0.5, so it could never have distinguished a learning engine from a broken one.

Relieving this means changing the learning rule — weighting each edge's update by its own
contribution to the chosen answer against the correct one — which changes what Haze is rather than
how fast it runs. It is therefore recorded here for an explicit decision rather than folded into
the vectorization silently.

### Conventions

The rewrite conforms to the workspace `src/{tokens,models,interfaces,modules,functions,errors,tests}`
layout, Pydantic models, the `[Verb][Domain][Qualifier]` function taxonomy, and the
docstring-per-declaration gate. Framework-mandated names (`forward`, `save_pretrained`,
`from_pretrained`, `state_dict`, `train`, `eval`) are exempt from the taxonomy; that exemption is
recorded in `specs/packaging.md`.

`pyproject.toml` maps `"haze" = "src"` rather than following `dusk-core-py`'s
`where = ["src"]`, which would install `functions`, `models`, and `tokens` as top-level import
names — acceptable for an internal lib, disqualifying for one published to PyPI and loaded from
the Hub as `from haze import Haze`.
